# NLP-DeepLearning
Here the topics are: 
Word Embedding, LSTM, Sequence2Sequence, Transformer  

**1.Word Embedding:**
- Load dataset
- Clean text
- Tokenize
- Train Word2Vec (CBOW / Skip-gram)
- Tune hyperparameters
- Save & load model
- Use it to predict:
- similar words
- analogy (king – man + woman = ?)
- vector for a word

**2. LSTM-Long Shot Term Memory**
